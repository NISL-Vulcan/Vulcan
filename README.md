### Quick Start
Getting started with vulcan Detection is simple and straightforward. Follow the installation instructions in the provided documentation, and you'll be ready to explore and customize the wide array of vulnerability detection models.
#### Required environment
- Python3 && PIP installed
- Linux/Windows/macOS
- Torch + CUDA enabled


#### Conda Installation
Type the following commands in your Shell
```
conda create -n vulcan && conda activate vulcan
git clone https://github.com/Asteriska001/vulcan-Detection
cd vulcan-Detection && chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

#### Direct Installation
Type the following commands in your Shell
```
git clone https://github.com/Asteriska001/vulcan-Detection
cd vulcan-Detection && chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
#### Docker Implementation
` TODO: docker run`

### Usage Example
This framework is primarily used through configuration files written in YAML syntax. 

These configuration files contain information about the model, dataset, metrics , preprocessing, as well as configurations required for training, validation, and inference. 

You can conveniently utilize it through **Jupyter Notebook** or opt for a **command-line** method.

We've already included several notebook files in the 'notebooks' directory for your reference. 
You're welcome to delve deeper into them.
#### Jupyter Notebook
Navigate to the 'notebooks' directory and use Jupyter in the way you're accustomed to.

#### Command-Line:
We take the ReGVD method paired with the REVEAL dataset as an example.
```
# Training
python tools/train.py --cfg configs/regvd_reveal.yaml

# Validation
python tools/val.py --cfg configs/regvd_reveal.yaml
```
And we have already provided some usable examples in the 'config' directory.
You can further inspect/check it.
